# We are...  
parents  
a multitude   
queer and exploring gender identity  
working on not being perfectionists  
independent arts workers  
realists and idealists  
mothers  
survivors because we were never meant to  
Interdependent reworlding via celebratory resistance  
thinking

# In our practices, we...  
enrich experiences of locations everywhere  
desire to use & understand technology but sometimes get confused by technology and frustrated by technology  
moving with curiosity and joy to explore the boundaries of our work  
heal heal heal heal heal  
build community  
are in play and in practice  


# We see resistance as...
creative resistance, the acceptable way to say eff this oppressive system, those that built it and those that perpetuate it  
trying to interrupt oppressive systems  
saying no  
amplifying many voices  
a way to communicate and express emotions and ways of thinking  
finding alternatives and dismantling boundaries  
advocating with community


# We are concerned by...
cross-disability seen as “sexy” and not always accepted in the justices  
the intentional obliviousness of society  
how surveillance is baked into our use of tech  
abuse of privilege  
total reliance on social media  
lacking concrete steps so practices aren't as grounded in making material change  


# We refuse...
to go through routine burnout  
to let others tell our story. We write our own narratives  
take advantage of cultural discontent to move my artistic practice forward  
to deny our gifts  
racism, transphobia, sexism, able-ism, sexual harassment  
continuation of unpaid labor  

# We want...
to bring people a sense of play and imagination  
to only work on projects we love  
more time spent in community  
to build our own tables instead of waiting for a seat at someone else's  
help create resources for other artists
to expand vision  
find solutions that are actionable  
to be part of networks & movements which can grow together in healthy & communicative ways


# We commit to...
Making community interaction a key part of my artistic practice, and not a means to an end  
Taking incremental steps  
being anti-ableist   
being antiracist  
listening  
a style that is safe for children to consume!!  
Regularly questioning how we are perpetuating hierarchical thinking within our actions and words  
doing My/OUR part  
being less harsh on ourselves while maintaining criticality  
breaking through isolation  
investing time to build stronger   relationships with communities we want to be accountable to
