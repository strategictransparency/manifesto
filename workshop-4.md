# We are...
artists

educators  
activists  
connected to each other because we are human  
technologists

white / POC  
listeners  
self-managed and autonomous

students  


# In our practices, we...
use art as a way to participate in the world

explore the possibilities of technology  
reflect on our roles and positions in our communities

stay aware of our contradictions  


# We see resistance as...
“I’ll always be too expensive to buy.” - Adrian Piper  
an ongoing struggle  
a constant learning process  
creative, tactical, poetic, teaching, disruptive, visionary, mutual aid, activism  
maintenance, care and kin  
survival  
giving a platform to underrepresented voices  
hopefulness  
cultural work  


# We are concerned by...
"The fracturedness through which artists make money."
Addictive mobile technologies  
Surveillance and Tracking  
Ownership and Capitalization of Ideas  
lack of diversity in some of the technology fields  
lack of attention to accessibility and diverse needs  
Oppressive power structures  
The fetishization of technology  
money  
power structures  
the speed of the moment  
artists being used to make technology more palatable  
the colonial history/legacy of art  
unhealthy competition for limited resources  

# We refuse...
colonialism  
racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism, patriarchy  
white supremacy  
work that is extractive or steals from others  
exploitation  
to be forced  
situations in which we can't be critical  
the artist as genius narrative  
the co-option of genuine collaboration by corporate practices  
To be disrespectful to someone/something through our art/process  
a boundary between creative resistance and activism: all resistance is creative  
To focus on only ourselves  
to be rushed  
To ignore the labor inherent in creative practice  


# We want...
Anti-capitalist structures for spaces and artists to exist  
More expansive definitions of authorship and ownership  
messiness, flaws, limitations  
"To move past neoliberal structures  
experience ourselves unmediated by technology"  
anti-capitalist support systems  
A destruction of the nonprofit and grant structure, replaced by a more equitable financial recognition of creative work  
Decolonization of current art standards, opening up new pathways for people who may not have felt they had access to the art world or title of “artist” - Sarah  
Slow durational work/experiences  
aesthetic beauty  
to create work that doesn't necessarily address personal identity  
to democratize joy  

# We commit to...
solidarity  
choose care over efficiency  
taking rest as a form of resistance  
making more non-screen based work  
rest and ethical working hours  
Being vocal about anti-crunch and anti-burnout practices  
keep having hope  
acknowledging our ancestors  
“Not hoarding data when I don’t know what I need it for.”  
staying open to new situations  
Including rest as essential and crucial to creativity  
being willing to stop work if it’s deemed harmful  
putting needs of the community first  
Being aware of social, environmental and ecological factors in work created
