# We are...
a group of interdisciplinary artists engaged with technology

# In our practices, we...
use technology not only a medium, but also a way to investigate social boundaries

# We see resistance as...
survival  
tactically orchestrating efforts of collected energies  
aggregating communities of shared interest, power  
trying to resist is a culture of answers
prejudicing the "other" a practice of subversion  
going against what is expected of us

# We are concerned by...
producing more noise  
becoming entertainment (where that was not the intention)  
focusing on the means rather than the ends  
not thinking in the long term  
an over-reliance on individual models of success  
production, production, more production...to what ends?  
the question of separating the creative from that which is considered not creative
binaries  
the idea of knowledge production; authorship; who produces content; and particularly role of art and design as a means of reproducing capitalist structures.  
how to support ourselves financially as we fo this work
capitalism's ability to insert itself into everything  
our inability to invent possible futures

# We refuse...
to exist in silos  
to participate in making gestures rendered empty  
to put the needs of one before the needs of many  
To critique without contributing a path forward  
To create work that satisfy my “Artist EGO”  
to make "content" for institutions  
to receive funding from evil orgs  
to accept the status quo

# We want...
rest  
collaboration  
to care for and be cared by  
to be paid to do nothing and to make work not for money  
to foster leadership and autonomy  
to be compensated for our time and energy  
To realize that artists have a responsibility with society, its not about making work only for me but for our community and others.  
everyday quotidian resistance  
the everyday resistance of the mundane  
to think about others before thinking about ourselves

# We commit to...
not only resisting but imagining the new  
acting on futurity  
considering whether something is necessary before diving into making it  
taking our time  
resisting being a robot in our daily lives, resisting our animal (programmed) temptations and cravings  
art with a lowercase "a"  
embracing humor  
movement building  
refraining from engaging with the superficial
