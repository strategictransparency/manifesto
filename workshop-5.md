# We are...
Individuals who are also parts of groups, communities, collectives, consortiums, and ultimately the body politic.  
Wanting to be more than boxes that are checked.  
Interested in using our existing privilege to tear down the systems which created them.

# In our practices, we...
Listen  
question, explore, examine  
Challenge  
empathyze, research, interact  
Intervene in existing systems  
push back against capitalism  
engage participatory practices  
are living beings not products  
connect through ideas and imaginations  
Use whatever means/media/format which will serve a concept  
fight, survive, grow  
Use technology to amplify the analog, expand accessibility  
Repurpose materials, reuse existing frameworks  
incorporate non-traditional ("off-label") uses for technology  
push back on competition.  

# We see resistance as...
articulating values  
building coalitions  
being vigilant and seeing through orgs/grants that are actually hypocritical  
a compilation of strategies  
creating opportunities of our own  
slowing down / patience  
supporting one another  
Dismantling polished notions of classist, corporate art   
Shifting value systems   
maintaining transparency  
self criticism  
a means of preserving integrity  
Bringing attention to critical issues in non-traditional, non-violent ways  


# We are concerned by...
being instrumentalized/controlled/shaped by the tech or institutions which we are trying to critique in the first place  
thinking we are being subversive and critical but really doing what they have wanted us to all along
unethical practices  
Rate of technological advancement in art is making many technologies inaccessible to more people, creating deeper disparities in who is being shown, supported, seen.  
Siloing of digital resistance efforts as result of algorithms and big tech banning/censoring.  
not knowing how things are made/ where they come from and the ethics around that process; also not seeing many alternatives for ethical consumerism with technology  
Becoming reflections of the very systems we seek to resist   
Power dynamics  
the quick acceleration of new technological development  
Using materials that pollute  

# We refuse...
to support bigotry, elitism, hierarchies, exclusivity  
work with with entities that so not align with our artistic principles  
To not pay people for their labor (to accept volunteer labor)  
To eat alone (when leading a group) because it is important to build community and that includes taking time for breaks with our teams  
to remain silent  
to get sucked into the mythology of the artist / art star  
to not acknowledge artists and collaborators for their work  
perfectionism  
To sell my soul, no matter how tempting  
To perpetuate closed source platforms  

# We want...
share our knowledge  
to use open-source repositories & softwares, but also hardware when available  
More inclusive creative environments  
Promote accessibility  
Equity in pay and contribution.  
Amplify the marginalized  
Democracy  
the chance to say no  
transparency in pay  
to acknowledge the contributions of others  
hold institutions accountable and reform them - help them become more helpful to our goals of democractic art making and cultural work that we want to see   
opportunities that we won't regret being associated with later :)  
to be able to bring more voices to the table because without them there is no progress
create cooperative futures across all species  
learn to be better listeners  
connection and community  
many different communities to be valued and archived and historicized  

# We commit to...
Listening, sharing  
Taking breaks to hear from others, to reflect on conversation and where people are coming from.  
Sharing, boosting, celebrating, publicizing  
Normalizing non-linear artistic career trajectories and working to remind others to do the same.  
+1 to the above :)  
Not falling into the old pattern of artist as elite - a neolib artist making luxury art without regard to the social fabric. Everything comes out of somewhere.  
Forming new ways of relating as workers (art is work) that don't replicate the empire :)  
Being sustainable and fairness  
listening, slowing down, anti-capitalist, anti-colonial practices   
engaging with things that make us uncomfortable / push us beyond complacency   
Share our code with others  
Strive for accessibility (physical, economic, etc.)  
Supporting artists and work that does not center white or economically privileged people
