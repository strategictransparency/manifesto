# We are...
Young people (I think) who are high creative dreamers who struggle, yet are grateful to be here.  
Students

Passionate individuals.  
A community with passion  
We are selfish/individualistic

# We see resistance as...
variables that obstruct personal growth and connection  
the unwillingness or lack of desire to act  
Questioning the status quo  
Challenging the biases woven into the system  
Action that aims to shift the status quo against an imposing force. The purpose for creative resistance is to provide another form of resistance that aims to convey messages through unique means.  
going against that which are the rules or guidelines of a particular thing.  
The way we question what has remained unquestioned in a given space  
Creative resistance is something individual. Creative resistance is futile when everyone does it because then it turns into something that's not subversive anymore.  
Opposition + critique, a thoughtful, caring, and informed engagement with histories of violence
A necessary disruptor in society, creative resistance can accomplish this.  
Effort  
the willingness to proceed even in the face of adversity  
standing up for what's right in our minds and letting our voices heard even if it involves the same co-hort  

# We are concerned by...

The world around us, the negativity centered around our existences, the limitations of our existences, the limitations that are placed on us by others because of our individual identities  
Barriers to inclusivity  
Our political climate here in the USA  
The current climate of the world both literally and metaphorically and how that will shape our future and our children's futures.  
Climate change  
Selling empathy: we need to spot the conflicts of interest that can in many situations undermine the attempts for positive messages and movements.  
The end of the world because of GLOBAL WARMING  
Our futures  
The lack of critical thinking when it comes to ideas of what it means to be "progressive" or "woke", as well as the idea that "indisputable facts" are now considered speculatory  
The many creatives who are "resisting" for the sake of resisting because they are told to resist.  

# We refuse...
To give up the fight against hate, of any kind  
bigotry, violence, oppression  
to fall victim to creative insecurities  
Hate, lack of being aware of the individual and the power we hold  
to be silenced  
To give up on our dream career  
To go along with something just because it's popular. Remember to question everything.  
Bigotry, racism, sexism, and being irresponsible with our privilege and the opportunities we were given.  
Denying Inclusivity  
Biased algorithms and ways of thinking
trolling  
Putting other people down even if we're on the "right side"  
To be divided  

# We want...
To treat people as equals regardless where they come from and what their political and philosophical beliefs are (within reason of course), because "a person is a person no matter how small".  
Work that helps people look deeper into ideas they never questioned or thought to question  
To be content, to feel fulfilled in our contributions to the world and to those who we admire/care about around us
to be able to have our work impact and influence the future as a positive net good.  
A happy future for all  
a fulfilling life, time to create such a life

speaking up for others if they are not able to do so  
taking accountability  
Trying to stand up for what we believe is the right thing to do, even if it doesn't get us "likes" or "re-tweets"  
Lifting those up who are down, but most importantly we commit to ourselves and our safeguard  
being honest, open and communicative about our needs and struggles while attempting to create a safe space for those we're working with.  
Being dedicated and passionate to our academic and professional careers
Bettering my community and overall society
taking up positive space in the world  
Working on ourselves
