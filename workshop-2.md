# In our practices, we...
engage with technologies to question, subvert, or understand them  
experiment with ways technology can extend our creativity and expression  
highlight and question norms and issues that affect our relationships with society, injustices, stereotypes  
are always learning  
are poetic, scholarly, artistic, playful, serious  
break rules  
create glimpses of other ways to make the world  


# We see resistance as...
the act of living in a chaotic world  
Speculative fiction  
giving people agency to share their experience without the burden of shame or fear or guilt  
a way to cope with future obstacles  
using tools against purpose  
Avoiding extraordinary harm; digital products and applications that make a direct assault on our own lives and wellbeing  
prototyping technologies that support a more egalitarian world and that reduce power asymmetries  
acknowledging bodies  
a way of moving forward  
embracing paradox  


# We are concerned by...
that technology distracts us from necessary political work  
having our work co-opted by the very systems that we are critiquing  
Silences, amnesia, trauma, forgotten histories  
the construction of "normality"  
the lack of motivation or feelings of indifference by people bogged down by oppressive forces or privileged to the point of complacency  

# We refuse...
to compromise our values  
the fantasy of objectivity  
to hoard wealth, data, and knowledge  
to be enamored by technology or to accept it as the solution to everything  
to deny the sociopolitical implications of our practices  
to forget   
to stay silent  


# We want...
push back on the systems we work with in and learn how to do it in a way that is generative, productive and transformative.  
Healing  
Change  
Restorative justice  
New conversations  
New collaborations  
a collectivist future  
Rest, and an understanding of the necessity of rest  
Build tools that give people agency  

# We commit to...
building an ecosystem that can better withstand attacks from our own patrons
working with duration  
improving the accessibility of knowledge related to coding  
destroying imposter syndrome  
understand how our work might use unsustainable or biased technologies, how it might exacerbate social injustices and climate crisis and work towards eliminating that  
Research  
Document  
Record  
Listen  
Speak up  
Not make assumptions  
Working with community rather than individuals  
Solidarity  
aligning our process with the values we are advocating for  
engaging with our communities and moving beyond esoteric notions of media art  
Allowing ourselves to say No and understand and accept for ourselves our points of refusal
