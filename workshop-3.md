action  
asking hard questions

the existing oppressive systems  
determining leadership in resistance -- who leads? who decides who leads? who gets credit for the work?  
the global economy  
accessibility/inaccessibility  
our work being used to reinforce what exists  
instant gratification and patches rather than structural repair (but we also see value in the momentary joys)  
racism and blatant discrimination in tech  
censorship  

# We refuse...
to make weapons that will aid in our continued oppression

to be stepped upon  
to snitch

# We commit to...
sharing the knowledge as much as we can  
be gentle with peer art critique and relentless with the critical understanding of our own art  
participate in the community  
being spiritual without being condescending  
being generous  
investing in and inviting in others  
making sure our values and ethics are reflected in the work that we put into the world  
fostering authentic friendships and collaborations  
not being afraid to be the change  
always be honest and fair because the world sure needs it!  
act for more visibility of marginalized voices  
honoring our ancestors in resistance  
learn from the past while stepping into the future.
