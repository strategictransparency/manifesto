# We are...
students, educators, artists, feminists, activists, technologists, and ultimately humans  
still try to figuring out who we are  
The offspring of nature, people of any nation and race  
uncomfortable with being boxed into categories in a fixed or unfluid way  
people whose identities are defined by the media we consume, the people we interact with/who we surround ourselves with  

# In our practices, we...
think about others  
research, design, create experiences online and in person, use humor  
challenge ourselves  
explore our identities and relationship to larger structures  
use technology as a means to reveal social/political structures  
evoke ultimate human reactions emotionally, sensationally  
take care of each other  
use tech as a extension of art tools to state questions and evoke debates  
be honest, contextual and critically think through the process of making and learning
embrace the practice of love  

# We see resistance as...
a daily practice  
How the NYU ITP program can be build and structured  
necessary  
"all resistance/activism is fundamentally a creative act" since we imagine what could be instead of accepting what is  
a way to create power collectively  
a demonstration of a point of view  
our own existence on the earth  
a way of minimizing and/or eliminating harm by existing institutions and infrastructures
being intentional about who we are, what/who we engage with, what resources we consume/create, what values we subscribe to/questioning those values  
making space  
subverting norms  
an active process, but rest can also be resistance  
not trying to be "cool"  
Be creative, but also make the project for a long term  

# We are concerned by...
resistance being used as a trend  
the typical relationship of capital  
our fixed mindset  
already pervasive notions  
the environmental impact of the tech industry and the future of energy availability and stability  
legitimizing and replicating oppressive and harmful systems  
our own participation in oppressive and harmful systems  
pessimism, nihilism, sense of powerlessness, lack of personal agency  
if all voices have chances to be heard  
basic needs not being met to a majority of the human population; violence  
the time it takes to engage with resistance, who is able to participate as a result  

# We refuse...
War and death  
More and more data collection  
More reality; not in the VR/AR/metaverse world forever  
use the power of creator to advocate a point irrationally  
neglection of underrepresented communities
to make work for oppressive structures/to collaborate with and amplify the voices of oppressive individuals  
to do harm  
to buy  
a hierarchical society  
violence  
let stereotypes to define who we are
abuse  

# We want...
to inspire other to go on with their own line of inquiries  
a safe space for different opinions  
equity  
freedom  
take actions for climate change  
healing  
restoration  
collaboration  
many perspectives  
security in the arts/social justice (personal, economic...)  
safe space  
everyone to have their basic needs met
to activate curiosity and imagination
humor  
passion  
music, groove to dance to....  

# We commit to...
being more thoughtful about audiences we make for and who is supporting the work
making our artwork accessible  
finding people we admire and seeing how we can align ourselves with them  
creating alternative spaces for artists
questioning who our audience is/why we are creating  
finding how projects can inspire action
how our projects can make us feel happy and fulfilled  
reusing and recycling and creating a little waste as possible  
acknowledging the historical and current political and social contexts we operate in
art making
