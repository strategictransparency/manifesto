# We are...
more than can be described  
more than a box to check off  
not alone  
navigators  
animals  
thoughtful  
paritcipants  
curious in learning and growth  
part of the community  
temporary collaborators, but also permanent collaborators (in an interdependent world)  
willing  
in solidarity  
making worlds  

# In our practices, we...
find pleasure  
make mistakes  
break patterns  
create resilience  
probe contradictions  
inspire others  
learn  
process trauma  
celebrate  
are self-aware  
create ourselves anew  
feel the world more clearly  
imagine worlds & selves otherwise  
queer prior understandings of the world  

# We see resistance as...
challenging dependencies << *i am curious on expanding on this to think through different kinds of dependencies*  
finding pleasure  
remembering who we are before we were colonized  
building the worlds we want to see  
valuing maintenance and care  
creating community spaces in the present & visions of the future where everyone is valued  

# We are concerned by...
the establishment of art or creativity as insular or monolithic entities  
our impacts (versus our intentions?)  
narrow conceptions about the meaning of technology  
white supremacy as a technology  
seeing corporate practices infiltrate our own behaviors  
burnout and survival  
the tension in technological dependencies
democracy, consensus and access in virtual spaces  
language that excludes  
making art driven by validation and digestibility  

# We refuse...
To simplify the story  
to think within binaries and ultimatums  
To let metrics guide our decisions or values  
to collaborate with empire  
for profit to be bae  
to be extractive  
to prioritize digital experiences over physical ones  
to let these psychopaths destroy the earth  

# We want...
a world where wages aren't a determining factor for the value of your role or practice  
to love! to make art that loves the world & other people & ourselves  
to teach people how to love  
to experience a very happy earth experience  
to be in community with each other (at least it seems by showing up here!)  
to try out ideas and see if they fit  
to honor  
to learn and grow as artists and individuals  
to embrace the difference and abnormal  
to be taken seriously  
to grow our conception of ourselves  

# We commit to...
getting consent from the people we are inspired by & use data from, relational instead of extractive processes  
sharing our knowledge + resources  
remaining open to feedback  
remaining open to the influence of others  
holding space for all voices  
letting our inner children take the wheel  
admitting mistakes, being gentle with ourselves  
maintenance and care  
accessibility AND nuance/complexity (the slash respresents extra complexity, lol)  
inviting new faces and ways of thinking into our spaces and practices  
working with not for
