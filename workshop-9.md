a convergence of overlapping attitudes that speaks to our values ... i.e. criticality and humor vs care and affordance

Resistance is actively making things available...but also being the person who does that thing.  
Resistance is safety.  
It is a transparent exchange and clear communication.  
Resistance is love.  
Being conscious of our input and output
necessary to our practice

perpetuating systems that we were trained in without thinking about why or how we are doing so  
materials scarcities and implications  
market driven structures of meaning overshadowing our potential for other forms of sociality  

# We refuse...
all the isms  
to engage with systems that negate discourse, i.e. use market driven ideas and values as a substitute for other forms of critical thinking, democracy, expression and care  
Platforming oppressive power stuctures  
to assume the answers
